In order to use leveldb with the engine, go to its GitHub repository and clone it.
Then, build it in Release mode by following the instructions from the repository.
After that, grab the "leveldb.lib" file from the "build" directory and the files
in the "include" folder.
Finally, repeat the steps that were performed for the other dependencies of this
project in order to properly use the header and the library files from leveldb
with the engine.

NOTE. In case some linker errors such as LNK2038 arise, it means that the leveldb
project has some project configuration values that are different from the ones
in the engine's project.
To solve this, see what configuration mismatches are reported by the generated
errors and change the leveldb's project configuration.
